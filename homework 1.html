	<h1>Toronto</h1>
	<p>Toronto, city, capital of the province of <b>Ontario</b>, southeastern <b>Canada</b>. It is the most populous city in Canada, a multicultural city, and the country’s financial and commercial centre. Its location on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario, which forms part of the border between <b>Canada</b> and <b>the United States</b>, and its access to Atlantic shipping via the St. Lawrence Seaway and to major U.S. Toronto has a <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;">continental climate </a> that is modified considerably by the proximity of the Great Lakes. Average temperature for January is in the low to mid-20s F (about –4.2 °C), but the wind chill factor can decrease this temperature considerably. In summer, the average July temperature is in the low 70s F (about 22.2 °C); however, it is not unusual to have summer days where the temperature exceeds 90 °F (32 °C) and the humidity is 100 percent.</p>

		  <li><b>About Royal Ontario Museum</b></li>
			<p>The Royal Ontario Museum was formally established on April 16, 1912,[8][9] and was jointly governed by the Government of Ontario and the University of Toronto.[10] Its first assets were transferred from the university and the Ontario Department of Education,[8] coming from its predecessor, the Museum of Natural History and Fine Arts at the Toronto Normal School.[11] On 19 March 1914, the Duke of Connaught, also the governor general of Canada, officially opened the Royal Ontario Museum to the public.[9] The museum's location at the edge of Toronto's built-up area, far from the city's central business district, was selected mainly for its proximity to the University of Toronto. The original building was constructed on the western edge of the property along the university's Philosopher's Walk, with its main entrance facing out onto Bloor Street housing five separate museums of the following fields: Archaeology, Palaeontology, Mineralogy, Zoology, and Geology.[9] It cost CA$400,000 to construct.[12] This was the first phase of a two-part construction plan that intended to expand the museum towards Queen's Park Crescent, ultimately creating an H-shaped structure.</p>
